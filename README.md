# EmployeeTracker

The objective of this project was to provide the user with a tool for managing employees in a company. I was to provide the user a command line application to: 
-Add departments, roles, employees

-View departments, roles, employees

-Update employee roles

This homework assignment primarily utilized Node.js and MySQL. This assignment gave me a lot of great practice utilizing MySQL to filter and call queries. I also got a lot of practice updating tables through the command line. Overall, it gave me great practice using a database, and I learned a lot while performing this homework assignment. It makes me excited to learn more backend technologies.
